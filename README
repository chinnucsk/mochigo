A simple sample application, as simple as it gets - showing how easy it is to
build an MochiWeb embedded application, using the Maven Erlang Plug-In
packaged MochiWeb artifact.

To compile and run, simply do the following:

> # 1) we get and install the MochiWeb artifact
> git clone git@github.com:olle/mochiweb.git
> cd mochiweb
> mvn install
> cd ../
> # 2) Getting MochiGo and run the app starter
> git clone https://github.com/olle/mochigo.git
> cd mochigo
> mvn erlang:run

Now you can browse to http://localhost:8888/ and you should see "MochiGo!".

NOTE: In this example I'm using the 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of the plugin,
that is still under development. The project is hosted on Sourceforge, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/erlang-plugin/.
