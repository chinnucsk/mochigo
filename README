A simple sample application, as simple as it gets - showing how easy it is to
build an MochiWeb embedded application, using the Maven Erlang Plug-In
packaged MochiWeb artifact.

More about Maven Erlang Plug-In at http://erlang-plugin.sourceforge.net/

NOTE: In this example I'm using the 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of the plugin,
that is still under development. The project is hosted on Sourceforge, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/erlang-plugin/.
